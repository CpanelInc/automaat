automaat

This is a collection of scripts to help automate Maatkit's
excellent MySQL replication checksumming tools.

master/run-maatkit.sh -- Run this on a master to create checksums
master/check-maatkit.sh -- This script fails when Maatkit hasn't been run in
                           the last two days.
slave/run-maatkit.pl -- Run this on a slave to find syncronization problems
slave/check-maatkit.sh -- This script files when Maatkit hasn't been run in
                          the last two hours, or if there syncronization problems.

You'll need to make sure the root user has SELECT and REPLICATION CLIENT privileges
on the master from both localhost and the slave. Store this information in 
/root/.my.cnf. To make life simpler, make the root password the same.
